Description: Propagates epistemic uncertainty in uniform-hazard spectral
  ordinates Sa(Tn) with the aleatory variability of empirical ground-failure
  models via weighted Monte Carlo convolution.  The key builders are:
  (1) fitDn() – combines multiple sliding-block Newmark displacement models
  (AM88, YG91, JB07, BT07, SR08, BM17, BM19) with sampled Sa, PGA, PGV and
  Arias intensity; (2) fitSaF() – convolves Sa(Tn) with the non-linear site
  factor F(ST17) of Stewart and Seyhan (2017) for a given Vs30; and
  (3) sampleSa() – draws Sa realisations at arbitrary periods consistent
  with hazard-curve quantiles using the sdQ method.  All functions return
  data.table objects for seamless downstream analysis and require only base R
  plus data.table, Hmisc and sdQ.
