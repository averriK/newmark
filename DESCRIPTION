Description: Propagates uncertainty from uniform-hazard spectral
  accelerations through empirical sliding-block and non-linear site-factor
  models using weighted Monte-Carlo sampling.  Builder sampleSa() draws
  Sa(Tn) realisations from hazard-curve quantiles; fitSaF() convolves those
  values with the Stewart & Seyhan (2017) site factor; fitDn() combines
  multiple Newmark displacement models to deliver scenario-specific
  quantiles.  Outputs are returned as data.table objects.
